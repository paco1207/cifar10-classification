# SCC361 Coursework 1 – MATLAB Project

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation and data files for SCC361 Coursework 1. The project includes a `.mat` data file and a corresponding `.m` script for analysis, accompanied by a report in DOCX format.

## 📘 Description

The project aims to demonstrate analytical and programming skills in MATLAB, involving:
- Data analysis using MATLAB `.mat` files
- A main `.m` script for processing or solving the problem
- A written report (`Report.docx`) that explains the approach, methods, and results

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- MATLAB (.m, .mat)
- Microsoft Word (.docx)

## 📂 Project Structure
